Sentiment Analysis Web App
This is a simple Sentiment Analysis Web App built with Streamlit and a pre-trained deep learning model. The app predicts whether a given text has a Positive or Negative sentiment.

Features:
Real-time Sentiment Prediction: Enter any text, and the app will analyze its sentiment.
Interactive UI: Clean and user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

How It Works:
The input text is preprocessed using a Tokenizer.
The text is padded to ensure uniform input size for the deep learning model.
A TensorFlow model predicts the sentiment based on the processed input.

Setup and Deployment:
Requirements
Python 3.8 or later
